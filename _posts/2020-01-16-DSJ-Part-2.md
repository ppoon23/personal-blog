## Mini-podcast

I was invited to talk about my experience so far in the Master's of Data Science Program at University of San Francisco. This program is packed and accelerated, but full of fun and enjoyable courses and moments. I discussed with two other students in the cohort on my background, courses, projects, and also what I do to stay active during COVID-19.
