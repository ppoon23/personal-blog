            "content": "My Data Science Journey - Part 1 . . This will be a multi-part series where I talk about my experience to provide some insights on my transition from Civil Engineering to Data Science. COVID-19 has affected a lot of people all over the world in 2020. Unemployment rates were falling, jobless cliams were spiking, and a lot of people were forced to close their business. It is a period full of uncertainty, chaos, and shock. I was one of the more fortunate folks who did not have to face the financial struggles. However I decided to switch my career to data science amid of all this unpredictable times (Am I crazy?!). I would like to share my story and hopefully this experience can inspire future adventurers who want to pursue data science. . After graduating with a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering with an emphasis in Water Resources in 2018, I took an Engineering-In-Training position at a consulting firm. My goal was to become a Professional Engineer (PE) and one day maybe lead a couple projects and become a project manager. My team consisted a lot more experienced PE’s around me and taught me a lot on how to deliver amazing projects. I learned a lot from them and managed to pass one of the three PE exams (In California, PE exams require seismic and suverying portions too). . However, I was slowly realizing how much I missed the research work that I did for my graduate degree. In short, my research was on understanding how wildfires affect evaporation and transpiration on the surface of the Earth. For my thesis, I performed statistical analysis, created maps and graphs, and ultimately trained a supervised learning model. I had no idea what I was doing was pretty much the field of data science! After researching online and finding out more about data science, I decided to give it a try in early 2020. . If you google how to learn data science, you will see tons of options and it can be quite overwhelming. Bootcamps, MOOC, Kaggle, etc… I ultimately decided to go back to school, and specifically I chose Unversity of San Francisco. There were numerous reasons that I chose USFCA over other universities: . Faculty members | Practical experience | Location | . First of all, coming from a Civil Engineering background, I value faulty members with practical experiences a lot. Their way of teaching and the materials can change how students feel. The faulty members at USF and The Data Institute are very knowledgable and full of practical experiences. Definitely a check for me. Secondly, USF offers practicum for all students! Students are paired with one of the companies / projects that they like. I personally find this very attractive and this is definitely nice to have on resume. Lastly, San Francisco is a big city and obviously a tech hub :) . With that being said, I am very happy and excited to be joining the USF Master’s of Data Science program this fall. Next, I will talk more about the first few courses, as well as learning remotely. . Thank you for reading and see you next time! .",

Estimating Evapotranspiration in a Post-Fire Environment Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning. Remote Sensing, 10(11), p.1728. . Abstract . In the hydrological cycle, evapotranspiration (ET) transfers moisture from the land surface to the atmosphere and is sensitive to disturbances such as wildfires. Ground-based pre- and post-fire measurements of ET are often unavailable, limiting the potential to understand the extent of wildfire impacts on the hydrological cycle. This research estimated both pre- and post-fire ET using remotely sensed variables and support vector machine (SVM) methods. Input variables (land surface temperature, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, normalized difference moisture index, normalized burn ratio, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, albedo and vegetation types) were used to train and develop 56 combinations that yielded 33 unique SVM models to predict actual ET. The models were trained to predict a spatial ET, the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), for the 2003 Coyote Fire in San Diego, California (USA). The optimal SVM model, SVM-ET6, required six input variables and predicted ET for fifteen years with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 8.43 mm/month and a R2 of 0.89. The developed model was transferred and applied to the 2003 Old Fire in San Bernardino, California (USA), where a watershed balance approach was used to validate SVM-ET6 predictions. The annual water balance for ten out of fifteen years was within ±20% of the predicted values. This work demonstrated machine learning as a viable method to create a remotely-sensed estimate with wide applicability for regions with sparse data observations and information. This innovative work demonstrated the potential benefit for land and forest managers to understand and analyze the hydrological cycle of watersheds that experience acute disturbances based on this developed predictive ET model. . .

Spatial and temporal evapotranspiration trends after wildfire in semi-arid landscapes. Journal of hydrology, 559, pp.71-83. . Abstract . In recent years climate change and other anthropogenic factors have contributed to increased wildfire frequency and size in western United States forests. This research focuses on the evaluation of spatial and temporal changes in evapotranspiration (ET) following the 2011 Las Conchas Fire in New Mexico (USA) using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Model (SSEBop ET). Evapotranspiration is coupled with soil burn severity and analyzed for 16 watersheds for water years 2001–2014. An average annual decrease of 120 mm of ET is observed within the regions affected by the Las Conchas Fire, and conifers were converted to grassland a year after the fire. On average, the post-fire annual ET in high, moderate, and low burn severity is lower than pre-fire ET by approximately 103–352 mm, 97–304 mm, and 91–268 mm, respectively. The ratio of post-fire evapotranspiration to precipitation (ET/P) is statistically different from pre-fire conditions (α = 0.05) in nine of the watersheds. The largest decrease in ET is approximately 13–57 mm per month and is most prominent during the summer (April to September). The observed decrease in ET contributes to our understanding of changes in water yield following wildfires, which is of interest for accurately modeling and predicting hydrologic processes in semi-arid landscapes. . .
